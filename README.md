# React Weather App

Checkout the [demo](http://reactweatherapp.arashsoheili.com/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You will need to obtain an API key from [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) to run the app.

To start the app:

1. Clone the repository
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

The initial page loads weather data obtained by ip address of your machine. It currently only supports weather lookup by zipcode.
